# ContTimeHetAgentExample
Simplified code to solve the benchmark model in Achdou et al (2017) and a simple model with housing

## See the pdf to read an overview of the model and the numerical methods

### Currently the code contains:
1. Matlab
  -  Code to solve the decision problem in the standard model with the implicit method
  -  Code to solve the decision problem with housing using the implicit method
2. Julia
  - Code to solve the decision problem in the standard model with the implicit or explicit model (Thanks to Garrett)
